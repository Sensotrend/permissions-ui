            This interactive demo runs fully locally on the browser, with no server communication.
          </summary>
          <p>When you load the page, it is initialized with three permission requests. When you
            grant any of the permissions (click the Allow button), a background thread starts that
            creates mock data access requests every 30 seconds. 
          </p>
          <p>The mock data access requests result in AuditEvents being created. You can watch these
            accumulate in the UI under the <strong>Inspect use...</strong> details element.
          </p>
          <p>You can also download the resulting HL7 FHIR Bundle of AuditEvent resources.</p>
          <p>A proper implementation would most likely group data access requests rather than just
            listing all of them.
          </p>
          <p>You can also download the Consent Receipt object as a signed JWE object, or you can
            store it to FairDrive. On an Android device, you can use the <a
            href="https://github.com/fairDataSociety/fairOS-dfs-android-demo/releases/">FairOS
            example app</a> to store the Consent Receipt into FairDrive.
          </p>
          <p>The other MyData operators are just listed as an example, and are not implemented. The
            point is to show that without proper Consent Receipt interoperability we would need to
            create an implementation for each of the operators separately. However, if the MyData
            operators would agree on a shared mime type for consent receipt, it would be enough for
            us to implement one <strong>Download Receipt</strong> button, and the implementation
            would work with all of them.
